# AngularMaterialApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.4, implementing a hexagonal architecture with Angular Material.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AngularMaterialApp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AngularMaterialApp
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

For automatic browser opening:

ng serve --open

## Code Structure

The project follows a hexagonal architecture with Angular best practices:

This README:

1. Is entirely in English.
2. Includes information about the hexagonal architecture.
3. Provides a more detailed project structure that reflects the hexagonal architecture.
4. Maintains all the essential information about building, testing, and running the Angular application.
5. Includes sections on contributing, versioning, authors, and licensing.
   Remember to adjust the links, usernames, and other project-specific information as needed. This comprehensive README will help new developers understand the project structure, the hexagonal architecture implementation, and how to contribute to the project effectively.

## Code scaffolding

Generate new components, services, etc. using Angular CLI. Examples:

- Component: `ng generate component features/component-name`
- Service: `ng generate service core/services/service-name`
- Module: `ng generate module features/module-name --routing`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

For production build:

ng build --configuration production

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

For coverage report:

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice.

Note: To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Linting and Formatting

- Run linter: `ng lint`
- Format code: `npm run format` (requires additional setup)

## Documentation

Generate project documentation:

npm run compodoc

## Hexagonal Architecture

This project implements a hexagonal architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) with the following key components:

- **Domain**: Contains the core business logic.
- **Ports**: Define interfaces for the application core.
- **Adapters**: Implement the interfaces defined by the ports.
- **Use Cases**: Orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities.
